# ODP Tornado API template

This template-project includes the basic building blocks needed to deploy and
application to our platform.

The components of this template:

- Example application
  - Python tornado-application
- Dockerfile
- Azure DevOps pipeline definition

## Getting started

### Installation

In order to use this template, you must first install cookiecutter. This is
simply done with pip

```shell
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

Windows users may need to do some extra steps. Please refer to the
[cookiecutter documentation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

### Usage - Directly from remote Git repo

Simply run cookiecutter to generate your project:

```shell
$ cookiecutter git+https://github.com/C4IROcean/template-tornado-app.git
```

Cookiecutter will prompt your to input some options, then finally generate a new
directory containing the full project and named by cookiecutter based on the
`project_name` you specified.

### Usage - Using local template

First clone this project template:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/C4IROcean/template-tornado-app.git template-tornado-app
```

You can then generate your own project using cookiecutter:

```shell
$ cookiecutter <MY_DIR>/template-tornado-app
```

Cookiecutter will prompt your to input some options, then finally generate a new
directory containing the full project and named by cookiecutter based on the
`project_name` you specified.

## Template description

### Example Python Application

This application serves as a placeholder for your application. It also includes
some packages to serve as inspiration for app-developers:

- **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) Package manager** - A modern Python
  package manager
- **[Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/options/#boolean-flags)** -
  Parser for command-line arguments
- **[Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)** - Async Web-framework for
  Python

### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile holds the definition of the containerized environment your
application will run in.

If your project is a simple Python {{cookiecutter.python_version}} app that uses
Poetry as its package manager, you will likely not have to make any changes to
this file. If your uses different ports or needs custom assets such as images,
then you may have to update this file.

## Azure DevOps pipeline definition

The Azure DevOps pipeline definition, located at
`.azure-devops/pipelines/azure-pipeline.yml`, holds instructions on how to build
and deploy your application. It has to be manually deployed from Azure DevOps in
order to use it.

The pipeline consists of two jobs - `Build` and `Deploy`. `Build` will build the
Dockerfile and save the resulting image to our Azure Container Registry.
`Deploy` will deploy the application using the definition in
`deployment_config.yml`.

This template is built in such a way that you should not need make any changes
to the `azure-pipeline.yml`-file. However, if you have more than one Dockerfile
or your app requires specialized build-steps, then you will need to update this
file.

### Using `deployment_config.yml`

`deployment_config.yml` is processed by the
[`app-deployer`](https://dev.azure.com/oceandatafoundation/ODP/_git/app-deployer),
and holds all the information necessary to deploy your app. Here you can add
supporting services, configure the deployment URL and add environment variables.
